<h2>A simple webpage to show stats and highscores on OSRS characters</h2>
<p>This is a dumb simple webpage that does nothing but rip data from the RuneScape API, and shows stats for OSRS characters only.
Its normal JS, Express, Pug/Jade. I thought using React for this project would be overkill, but this might limit it in the future
if i end up wanting to increase the scope.</p>

<h3>TO RUN</h3>

* Make sure you have Node installed<br>

```shell
node -v
```
* Clone the repo<br>
* Open the repo in your favourite editor<br>
* Open a terminal or command line in the root directory of the project, run

```shell
npm i
```
* Then run the following to start the server

```shell
npm run dev
```
* The webpage should now be running at localhost:3000!
