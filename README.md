<h2>A simple webpage to show stats and highscores on OSRS characters</h2>
<p>This is a dumb simple webpage that does nothing but rip data from the RuneScape API, and shows stats for OSRS characters only.
Its normal JS, Express, Pug/Jade. I thought using React for this project would be overkill, but this might limit it in the future
if i end up wanting to increase the scope.</p>
